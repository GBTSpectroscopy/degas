This directory holds analysis scripts and the central DEGAS
database. The analyssi scripts assume that you have the following
paths set in a shell script.

# Data Reduction
export DEGASDIR=/lustre/cv/users/akepley/degas/reduction
export GBTWEATHER=/lustre/cv/users/akepley/degas/reduction/GBTWeather/

# Analysis
export MASKDIR=/lustre/cv/users/akepley/degas/reduction/masks
export OTHERDATA=/lustre/cv/users/akepley/degas/ancillary_data
export DATABASEDIR=/lustre/cv/users/akepley/degas/database
export SCRIPTDIR=/lustre/cv/users/akepley/degas/reduction/code/degas/scripts
export PLOTDIR=/lustre/cv/users/akepley/degas/plots
export TABLEDIR=/lustre/cv/users/akepley/degas/tables

The full analysis is:

# set up data base and sample
get_fid_params.py
make_sample_table.py
plot_sample_v2.py

# set up CO 
fix_up_other_data.py

make_masks.py -- ADD CO mom0, peakInt, mom1, and peakVel to this? I
think this will make the process easier than doing in other
scripts. Otherwise, I'm going to have to coordinate the order in the
make_masks.py and CO processing script, which could lead to subtle
bug.s

# diagnostics for reduced data
make_diagnostic_moment_maps.py

# set up data for analysis
setup_analysis.py -- a whole bunch of regridding, etc for analysis.
